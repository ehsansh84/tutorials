To install OpenEBS as a local storage provisioner on Kubernetes, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the OpenEBS Helm chart repository:

```bash
helm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/charts
helm repo update
```

2. Create a Kubernetes namespace where OpenEBS will be installed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace openebs
```

3. Install OpenEBS using Helm:

```bash
helm install openebs --namespace openebs openebs/openebs
```

4. Verify that the OpenEBS components are running by checking the pods in the `openebs` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n openebs
```

Ensure that the OpenEBS pods, such as `mayainstaller`, `ndm`, `localpv-provisioner`, and others, are running and in a ready state.

5. Once OpenEBS is installed, you can create a storage class to use local storage. Here's an example YAML file (e.g., `local-storage-class.yaml`) for a storage class definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-local
provisioner: openebs.io/local
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

In this example, the storage class is named `openebs-local`, and it uses the `openebs.io/local` provisioner.

6. Apply the storage class definition using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f local-storage-class.yaml
```

7. Verify that the storage class has been created:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

You should see `openebs-local` in the list of available storage classes.

Now you can use the `openebs-local` storage class in your Kubernetes manifests to request local storage volumes for your pods or persistent volumes (PVs).

Please note that OpenEBS provides advanced features for managing storage, such as creating storage pools and storage replicas. Make sure to refer to the OpenEBS documentation for detailed configuration and usage instructions specific to your requirements.
