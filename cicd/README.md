# About CICD
### What is a CI/CD pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of software delivery. It builds code, runs tests, and helps you to safely deploy a new version of the software. CI/CD pipeline reduces manual errors, provides feedback to developers, and allows fast product iterations.

CI/CD pipeline introduces automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of a software product. It involves from the integration and testing phase to delivery and deployment. These connected practices are referred as CI/CD pipeline.

### What is Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?
- **Continuous integration** is a software development method where members of the team can integrate their work at least once a day. In this method, every integration is checked by an automated build to search the error.
- **Continuous delivery** is a software engineering method in which a team develops software products in a short cycle. It ensures that software can be easily released at any time.
- **Continuous deployment** is a software engineering process in which product functionalities are delivered using automatic deployment. It helps testers to validate whether the codebase changes are correct, and it is stable or not.
